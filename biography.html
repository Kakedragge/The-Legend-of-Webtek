		<h1>Biography </h1>
		
		<p> Tom Tomsen (14. April 1958) is an artist from Norway,  born to modest parents in a small village where no one would think anyone would live. His father was a mineworker and his mother a housewife, he has four siblings, one brother and three sisters. </p>
		
		<p> From an early age Tom was obsessed with art, he could spend hours drawing small pieces. Sadly his teachers didnt encourage him, rather he got bullied for playing with his "silly drawings". At home there was also little encouragment, his dad never expected his children to be more than simple manual workers or housewives. He would chastise Tom for "wasting his time" and his siblings would make fun of him. </p>
		
		<p> At age of 16 Tom had enough, the year was 1974 and he left home for the big city. He spent the next 5 years working at an art museum as night security. He rented a small room and spent his days practicing art and nights being surrounded by it. This was a very important time in Toms life as it was now he picked up on his various styles and signatures he would use later in life.</p>
		
		<p> Finally after 5 years Tom figured he needed to take his art development to the next level, in 1979 he enrolled into the prestigious University of Art. Tom spent the next 9 years of his life there, as he was only studying part time. His night security job was quickly replaced by a afternoon janitor job at the same museum. </p>
		
		<p> Tom graduated 24. July 1987. After 9 hard years he was ready to take on the world of art. His first masterpiece, was an animal panting of a snake called Snake(1987) that later would belong to his set of pantings known as L'enfants terribles </p>
		
		<p> For the next few years Tom made few paintings, he made a second L'enfants terrible painting, Solid(1990). And finally in 1999 he won an award for exceptional accomplishments in arts, for among other his L'enfants terrible painting Liquid(1998), while very similar to Solid, Liquid was noted to be a new approach in a totally differenct style. </p>

		<p> Tom was now newly inspired, he made many new paintings like Ghost (2000) among other and continued his L'enfant terribles series with Solidus (2001), Naked (2004) and Old (2008). He also started practicing more photography, a hobby he enjoyed, but had spent little time on. </p>
		
		<p> In 2010 Tom won the 3rd place in a prestigious art contest. Showing that he still got it. He made his final contribution to the L'enfant terrible series with two more pantings Punished (2014) and Venom (2015). He has also started to take in young aspiring artist to teach them the craft, with the hope of them following in his footstep, becoming bright artists themselves </p>
